Trump’s Administration and Mexican President Andres Manuel López Obrador’s Administration met with energy stakeholders to highlight the importance of the United States-Mexico energy relationship, share priorities for the energy sector, and identify opportunities for collaboration on areas of mutual interest.\nDuring the meeting, representatives underscored the importance of promoting comprehensive energy security for both countries. Mexico is the United States’ second-largest energy trading partner and continues to be one of the most important destinations for U.S. exports of energy-related equipment, technologies, and services. The United States is the largest buyer of Mexico’s crude oil exports. This trade underpins the robust energy relationship between the two countries.\nThe Council will next meet in Washington later this year.\n ","type":"news_blog","link":"http://ita-dev.mobomo.net/news-blog/readout-sixth-us-mexico-energy-business-council-meeting","countryregionlocation":"","created":"1571690302","changed":"1575576690","country":[],"industry":[],"trade_topic":[]},{"id":"bc976171ea22d625be96fd8bccb8720f808dc4c8","rowcount":23,"nid":"70","uuid":"15e9986e-1701-4c1a-b419-495dae6ae473","title":"Testing Topic T5 Landing Page","summary":"","renderedentity":"Resolve a Trade Problem\n      \n            \n        Are you encountering a trade barrier in a foreign market or an unfair practice by a foreign company importing into the U.S.?  \r\nHere you will find government services that help U.S. businesses resolve common trade problems.\n      \n                \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n      \n      \n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      Testing Topic T5 Landing Page\n\n        \n    \n      \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n            \n        \n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    50% of U.S. companies exporting today, only export to ONE market\n\n           “A Basic Guide to Exporting” is an overview of the fundamentals in exporting, designed for small to medium sized companies who are considering finding new market segments overseas.\n    \n          \n        \n\n  \n     Continue Reading If You Want to live\n    \n    \n\n  \n\n\n      \n      \n\n\n      \n      \n\n\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n  \n    \n      \n            Generic Article multi-line title for the Featured Article - Article Content Type\n\nIntro paragraph, larger text size — Setting your compass in international trade can be rewarding, but challenging.
